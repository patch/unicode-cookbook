# Count characters of a string in Ruby

## Code points

The `length` or `size` methods are available for `String` objects.

```ruby
count = str.length
```

```ruby
count = str.size
```

## Grapheme clusters

The core language does not provide a way to count grapheme clusters. If you know
of a library with this functionality, please contribute it here.
